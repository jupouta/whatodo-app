A project to give you things to do when you're feeling bored.

- The front page suggests you something to do, and tells the time it takes to do that task.
- If you don't want to do that and/or want something that takes more or less time, you can choose the time frame for the activity.
- You can also look at all the possible activities.

This project was made with Python Flask. For the web things, html and css were naturally used.
